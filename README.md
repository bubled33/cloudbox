## Technology Stack

The Cloud File Storage system is built using a **modern Go ecosystem**, combining high-performance web frameworks, reliable databases, scalable queues, and background workers.

| Layer / Purpose               | Technology / Library                          | Notes / Usage |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Programming Language**      | Go (Golang)                                   | Main backend language, compiles to a single binary, suitable for high-performance services |

> - **Gin + GORM** is a lightweight and standard stack for Go web services.  
> - **Kafka** allows scaling background workers and handling high task volumes asynchronously.  
> - **MinIO** is used for local development instead of S3.  
> - **Workers** use Go routines and Kafka consumers to keep API responsive while processing heavy tasks asynchronously.

## Architecture

**Project Architecture**: Cloud File Storage is implemented as a **monolithic application** using a layered and hexagonal approach.  
This structure ensures clear separation of responsibilities, testability, and maintainability while keeping deployment simple.

**Layered Structure**:
- **Presentation / API Layer** – handles HTTP requests, magic links, file upload/download, and public link generation.
- **Application / Service Layer** – coordinates file operations, versioning, link management, and background tasks.
- **Domain / Core Layer** – contains business logic and entities (User, File, FileVersion, MagicLink, PublicLink).
- **Infrastructure Layer** – concrete implementations of external dependencies: database (Postgres), object storage (S3/MinIO), task queue (Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka).

**Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Principles**:
- The **Domain Layer** is independent of external services.
- **Ports** define interfaces for database access, storage operations, and queue interactions.
- **Adapters** implement these interfaces, allowing easy replacement of infrastructure components without changing business logic.

**Background Workers**:
- **Preview Worker** – asynchronously generates file previews by consuming tasks from the queue.
- **Public Link Expirer** – deactivates public links after TTL expires.
- Workers run inside the monolith but interact through the task queue for asynchronous execution and scalability.

> ⚠️ **Monolith vs Microservices:**  
> Although modern cloud systems often use **microservices**, this project is implemented as a **monolith** for practical reasons.  
> 
> - **Simplicity** – keeping all business logic, API routes, and background workers in a single application makes the code easier to understand and maintain.  
> - **Ease of Deployment** – only one service needs to be deployed, while external dependencies like the database, object storage, and task queue remain separate.  
> - **Testing and Development** – running a monolith locally is straightforward, without managing multiple interdependent services.  
> - **Scalability of Critical Components** – even in a monolithic setup, the **Preview Worker** and **Public Link Expirer** can scale independently via multiple processes and queues.  
> - **Future Flexibility** – the codebase is organized with **Layered + Hexagonal architecture**, so it can be refactored into microservices if needed.

## ER Diagram

The diagram below shows the main entities of the **Cloud File Storage** system (Google Drive Lite), including users, files, file versions, sessions, magic links, and public links.  
It illustrates the relationships between tables and the cardinality of each association.

**Legend:**
- `{PK}` = Primary Key  
- `{FK}` = Foreign Key  
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` = dependent rows are automatically deleted  
- `1` = one, `*` = many  
- Denormalization: some fields (e.g., `name`, `size`, `mime` in `files`) are duplicated from `file_versions` for faster access.

> ⚠️ **Note on normalization:**  
> The `files` table duplicates some attributes from `file_versions` (name, size, mime, etc.).  
> This technically violates **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** because these attributes depend on the related `file_versions` record, not directly on the `files` primary key.  
> This denormalization is intentional to speed up queries for listing files, showing file metadata, and avoiding frequent joins. In production systems, this trade-off is common for performance reasons.

## Security / Authentication

The Cloud File Storage system implements **passwordless authentication** and several security measures to protect user data, files, and public links.

### Authentication

- **Magic Links (Passwordless Login)**  
  - Users authenticate via temporary magic links sent to their email.  
  - Each magic link contains a **signed token** with an expiration time (TTL).  
  - Once verified, a **session token (JWT)** is issued for API requests.  
  - No passwords are stored in the database, reducing the risk of credential leaks.

- **Session Management**  
  - Sessions are stored in the database with expiration times.  
  - API requests must include a valid session token in the `Authorization` header.  
  - Expired sessions require users to request a new magic link.

### Authorization

- **File Access Control**  
  - Users can only access files they own or files shared via valid public links.  
  - Database foreign key constraints and application logic enforce ownership rules.

- **Public Links**  
  - Temporary links have a **TTL ≤ 600 seconds**.  
  - **Public Link Expirer** automatically deactivates expired links.  
  - Access via public links bypasses authentication but is limited to read-only operations.

### Data Protection

- **Transport Security**  
  - All API traffic must use HTTPS.  
- **File Storage Security**  
  - S3/MinIO buckets can be configured with server-side encryption.  
- **Sensitive Data Handling**  
  - Only minimal metadata is stored in the database; no plaintext passwords.  

> 💡 **Notes:**  
> - The combination of passwordless login, TTL-based links, and secure transport ensures both usability and security.  
> - Additional measures, such as 2FA or encryption at rest for files, can be added in future improvements.

## API Documentation

The Cloud File Storage system exposes a **RESTful API** to manage users, files, file versions, magic links, and public links. All endpoints use **JSON** for request and response payloads.

| Endpoint                     | Method | Description                                         | Request Body / Params | Response |
|-------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|
| `/auth/magic-link`            | POST   | Request a passwordless login link for a user       | `{ "email": "user@example.com" }` | `{ "magic_link": "https://..." }` |
| `/auth/magic-link/verify`     | POST   | Verify magic link and create a session             | `{ "token": "..." }` | `{ "session_id": "..." }` |
| `/files/upload`               | POST   | Create a new file record and get upload URL        | `{ "name": "file.pdf", "size": 1024 }` | `{ "file_id": 123, "upload_url": "https://..." }` |
| `/files/download/{file_id}`   | GET    | Download the latest version of a file             | Path param: `file_id` | File stream |
| `/files/{file_id}/versions`   | GET    | List all versions of a file                        | Path param: `file_id` | `[ { "version_id": 1, "size": 1024, "created_at": "..." }, ... ]` |
| `/public-links`               | POST   | Generate a temporary public link for a file       | `{ "file_id": 123, "ttl": 600 }` | `{ "public_link": "https://..." }` |
| `/public-links/{link_id}`     | GET    | Access a file via public link                      | Path param: `link_id` | File stream |
| `/files/{file_id}/preview`    | GET    | Get the preview for a file                         | Path param: `file_id` | Image/Thumbnail stream |
| `/users/me`                   | GET    | Retrieve current user profile                      | Auth token in header | `{ "id": 1, "email": "user@example.com", "files": [...] }` |

> 💡 **Notes:**  
> - All endpoints require authentication via **session token** except public link access.  
> - File upload is handled via **pre-signed URLs** for direct S3/MinIO access.  
> - Preview generation is asynchronous; `/files/{file_id}/preview` may return a placeholder if preview is not ready yet.  
> - Public links respect `TTL` (max 600 seconds) and expire automatically via **Public Link Expirer**.
